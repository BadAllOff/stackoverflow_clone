#
# The first argument to `can` is the action you are giving the user
# permission to do.
# If you pass :manage it will apply to every action. Other common actions
# here are :read, :create, :update and :destroy.
#
# The second argument is the resource the user can perform the action on.
# If you pass :all it will apply to every resource. Otherwise pass a Ruby
# class of the resource.
#
# The third argument is an optional hash of conditions to further filter the
# objects.
# For example, here the user can only update published articles.
#
#   can :update, Article, :published => true
#
